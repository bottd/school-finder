## Reflection

This was a self-directed project at the end of Module 3 at Turing School of Software & Design.  

I set out to build a React - Redux web application built on top of a Firebase Database and Google Maps APIs that allowed users to quickly and easily search for and get directions to schools within their desired commute parameters for their kids. I am very comfortable with React and Redux and was excited to build a robust application with them that presented data from the internet in a more helpful and productive way for parents.

This project was a great opportunity to continue building my skills in React and Redux while learning a lot about how to implement Google Maps API service.  As a front-end developer, it was also beneficial to spend some time thinking about the database I was building with DPS school data scrubbed from a CSV file downloaded from their website.

The biggest challenge I had was with rendering directions on the page in a React framework.  To solve the problem, I imported a JS library that gave me pre-build components to implement in my code. This ended up being a really great learning opportunity for me and  am excited to continue to explore additional libraries in future projects.

As a former staff member at Teach For America, I care deeply about making sure all children have the opportunity to attain an excellent education and this project reflects my desire to use my skills as a developer and problem solver to ensure that is a reality.
